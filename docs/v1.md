# Harmony API v1
This document introduces how to use the harmony websocket.

## Connecting
The websocket is hosted at ```ws://74.197.196.228:8080```. <br>
After you connect, send ```&&j-(replace with username)``` so the server knows who you are.

## Messaging
> [!NOTE]
> When you send a message, the server will send it back to you.

When a message is received, it's format is: <br>
```json
{
   "username": "Nufer", 
   "message": "i think i saw someone talking to a tree", 
   "date": 1758408074364 
}
```
To send a message, you send something similar: <br>
```json
{
   "username": "Teast",
   "message": "you don't do that?",
}
```
Commands are parsed automatically by the server. The server responds with the username "&&HarmonyServer", so you can add a special style to it.<br>
<br>
Yippie! That's everything!!!<br>
